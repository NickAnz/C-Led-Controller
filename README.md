This is simple GUI application to control a 12v led strip, as the strip used was not individually addressible it uses a simple R,G,B and power connection to select which colour can be used. This appilcation makes it easy to select which colour will be used.

Along with this is some diffrent modes that have been included if a single colour just isnt enough.
